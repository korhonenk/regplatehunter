# regplatehunter
Angularjs, Android project for registerplatehunting in Finland (boring hobby, but still a hobby)

In this project I'll attempt to create a neat android app for register plate spotting. 
Project will be spring boot, angular in the front and some very lightweight db (still undecided).


About register plate spotting:

Register plate spotting is about spotting plates in ascending (or desc) order. 

In Finland register plates are in form of AAA-111 where the numbers can be between 1 - 999 never starting with a 0.
I have been spotting register plates for a few years now and am going through them in asc & desc order. (asc: 254, desc: 223). 

Lately I've been writing notes on phone where to find each nearby number, but a dedicated app would be fun to create.
